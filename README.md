## Project overview

This repository is a pnpm-powered monorepo for **Echo**, a comprehensive B2B SaaS customer support platform with three applications and shared packages. It uses Turborepo for task orchestration, a Convex backend for realtime data and serverless functions, shared UI built on shadcn/ui and Radix primitives, and modern auth and AI integrations.

### Monorepo layout

```
apps/
  web/       # Main dashboard app (Next.js 15) - Admin interface
  widget/    # Embeddable support widget (Next.js 15) - Customer-facing widget
  embed/     # Embeddable script (Vite) - JavaScript widget for external sites
packages/
  backend/   # Convex backend (functions, schema, AI agents, RAG)
  ui/        # Shared UI components (shadcn/ui-based)
  eslint-config/ # Shared ESLint configurations
  typescript-config/ # Shared TypeScript configurations
  math/      # Example shared utility package
```

### Tech stack

- **Runtime/build**: pnpm workspaces, Turborepo, TypeScript 5.x
- **Apps**: Next.js 15, React 19, App Router, Vite (for embed)
- **Styling/UI**: Tailwind CSS 4.x, shadcn/ui components, Radix UI primitives, `lucide-react`
- **State**: Jotai in apps; local atoms per module
- **Backend**: Convex 1.25.4 (functions, schema, realtime), `convex-helpers`
- **Auth**: Clerk (`@clerk/nextjs` in `web`, `@clerk/backend` in `backend`)
- **AI**: `@convex-dev/agent`, `@convex-dev/rag`, `ai`, `@ai-sdk/google` (Gemini 2.5 Flash/Pro)
- **Voice**: VAPI Web SDK (`@vapi-ai/web`, `@vapi-ai/server-sdk`)
- **Forms/validation**: `react-hook-form`, `zod`, `@hookform/resolvers`
- **Tooling**: ESLint (shared config), Prettier, TypeScript project refs

### High-level architecture

- The **`web` app** is the authenticated admin dashboard. It integrates with Clerk for auth and consumes Convex functions from `packages/backend`. UI is composed from `packages/ui`.
- The **`widget` app** is an embeddable customer support widget that provides chat, voice, and contact functionality. It integrates with Convex and VAPI for live AI-assisted conversations.
- The **`embed` app** is a lightweight JavaScript widget that can be embedded on external websites. It creates an iframe to the widget app and handles positioning and messaging.
- The **`backend` package** (Convex) defines schema, public/private functions, system workflows, and AI agents/RAG utilities. It powers all three applications.
- Turborepo manages build, dev, and lint pipelines across the workspace. Shared code is versioned as workspace packages.
